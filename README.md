#### **I'm currently studying Machine Learning**
I finished Andrew Ng's ML specialization and gone through details of Machine Learning Under the hood<br>
**See LUNA-R repository**

#### However In real Life ML engineers use frameworks and different useful techniques
I think there's no good studying without practice, so here it is.<br>

## **Structure**
Repository Has The following system of Levels:

> Field (ML/DL)
> > Resources/Topic
> > > Data (if possible to upload) and code

I want to be good Machine Learning Engineer, so I'll try my best in High Quality Projects.<br>
